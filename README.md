Unity 2017 project

## Models

All models here were recreated by me from reference images (since early 2008) and now placed in the public domain.

* [gnome.blend](unity/Assets/models/gnome) - based on the orignal image by [Asci](http://www.gamedev.ru/art/forum/?id=5592)
* [gnomeland.blend](unity/Assets/models/gnomeland) - based on the orignal image by [Asci](http://www.gamedev.ru/art/forum/?id=5592)
* [gnomedog.blend](unity/Assets/models/gnomedog) - based on the orignal image by [Polter](http://www.gamedev.ru/art/forum/?id=5592&page=156#m2335)
* [gnomecar.blend](unity/Assets/models/gnomecar) - based on the orignal image by [Dart_Vader](http://www.gamedev.ru/projects/forum/?id=8855&page=2#m16)
* [swiborg.blend](unity/Assets/models/swiborg) - based on the original image by [Zudl](http://www.gamedev.ru/flame/forum/?id=66447)

I'm only responsible for the geometry, all reference images and most of the textures belong to their respectable owners.
